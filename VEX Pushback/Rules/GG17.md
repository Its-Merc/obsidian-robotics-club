No [[Holding]] for more than 3 seconds
- counted by referees
- counting stops when
	- the distance between the two robots is more than 2 feet
		- about a foam tile
	- gets held by a different robot

	- after it stops, there is a 5 second count
		- if [[Holding]] resumes within that count, the 3-second countdown resumes where it left off
		- otherwise it is "waved off"
