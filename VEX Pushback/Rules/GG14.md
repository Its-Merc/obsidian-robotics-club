Don’t destroy other Robots

- [[Robot|Robots]] that are only built for destroying/[[Entanglement|Entangling]] opposing [[Robot|Robots]] aren't allowed
- offense is allowed though

- defensive play without destructive/illegal strategies is part of the rule
- incidental [[Entanglement]], tipping, damage, etc. are to discretion of [[Head Referee]]
- A [[Robot]] shouldn't be designed that its easily tipped over/damageable with minor contact

- accidental tipping caused by [[Block|Blocks]] leaving [[Goal/Goals]] isn't a part of this
